Cyber security is an essential aspect of modern life, as more and more of our personal and professional activities take place online. However, despite its importance, there are many misconceptions and myths surrounding cyber security that can lead to confusion and a false sense of security. In this blog post, we will examine some of the most common myths about cyber security and debunk them to help you better understand and protect yourself online.

## Myth #1: Only large companies need to worry about cyber security

One of the most common myths about cyber security is that it only affects large companies and organizations. In reality, small and medium-sized businesses are just as vulnerable to cyber attacks as larger ones, if not more so. In fact, according to the National Cyber Security Alliance, 60% of small businesses that experience a cyber attack go out of business within six months. Therefore, it is important for all businesses, regardless of size, to take cyber security seriously and invest in appropriate measures to protect themselves.

## Myth #2: Macs and iPhones are immune to viruses

Another common myth is that Macs and iPhones are immune to viruses and other malware. While it is true that these devices are less susceptible to malware than Windows PCs, they are not completely immune. In fact, according to a report by cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes, Macs accounted for nearly 10% of all malware detections in 2019. Additionally, the rise of mobile malware targeting iOS devices has been on the rise, making it important to protect all of your devices with anti-virus software and keep them updated.

## Myth #3: Changing your password every few months improves security

Another myth is that you should change your passwords every few months to improve security. This advice was once considered best practice, but it is now outdated. The current advice is to use a unique, strong password for every account, and to use a password manager to keep track of them. If a password is compromised, you should change it immediately and not wait for a set interval.

## Myth #4: Firewalls protect against all types of cyber attacks

Many people believe that a firewall is all they need to protect their computer or network from cyber attacks. While a firewall can help to block unauthorized access to a network, it does not protect against all types of cyber attacks, such as malware, phishing, and social engineering. A comprehensive security solution that includes firewalls, antivirus software, and other security measures is required to protect against a wide range of cyber threats.

## Myth #5: Antivirus software is unnecessary if you don't download anything

Many people believe that if they don't download anything, they don't need antivirus software. However, this is not true. Antivirus software is not just to protect against malware that is downloaded, but also to protect against malware that may be present on a website or email attachment.

In conclusion, cyber security is a complex and constantly evolving field, and there are many myths
and misconceptions surrounding it. By understanding and debunking these myths, you can better
protect yourself and your business from cyber attacks. It is important to stay informed and up to
date on the latest cyber security threats, and to take appropriate measures to protect yourself and
your data.
